# 📦 Flipkart Case Study: Increasing User Reviews Through Post-Purchase Innovation

This product case study explores how Flipkart can boost the number of user reviews on its platform by redesigning the post-purchase experience — making it more intuitive, rewarding, and mobile-first.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Despite being India’s leading e-commerce platform, Flipkart faces low user review rates, especially post-delivery. This leads to:
- Lower buyer trust
- Weaker product visibility (SEO/ranking)
- Fewer insights for sellers
- Reduced conversions on product pages

---

## 🎯 Objective

**Goal**: Transform the post-purchase flow into a trust-building and engaging experience to significantly increase **user review submissions**.

---

## 🧰 Methods & Frameworks Used

- **KPI Tree**: Mapped goals like awareness, adoption, and retention to measurable KPIs.
- **Actor Mapping**: Identified key stakeholders — end users, sellers, Flipkart support, logistics teams.
- **User Research**: Combined **primary insights** (surveys, user quotes) and **secondary research** (industry benchmarks, competitor strategies).
- **Persona Development**: Focused on mobile-first, Gen-Z and millennial buyers from Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities.
- **Funnel-Based Metrics**: Awareness → Activation → Engagement → Retention → Satisfaction.
- **Pitfall Analysis**: Identified risks and created targeted mitigation strategies.
- **Gamification Framework**: Designed rewards and habit loops to sustain behavior.

---

## 🎯 Target Users

- Young working adults (21–35), mobile-first users from Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities
- Frequent Flipkart shoppers who prefer quick, visual feedback
- Heavy WhatsApp/Instagram users who rarely revisit the Flipkart app post-delivery

---

## 🔍 Key User Insights

- 6 out of 10 users **forget to leave a review** without reminders

- Users check WhatsApp more often than shopping apps
- Review forms feel **long and robotic**
- Value of giving reviews is unclear to most users

---

## 💡 Proposed Solutions

### 1. 🧠 SmartPrompt
> **What:** Contextual nudges via app notification or WhatsApp  
> **Why:** Reaches users at the right time post-delivery  
> **How:** Reduces friction and forgetfulness to boost submission

---

### 2. 📸 QuickSnap Review
> **What:** Lets users share a 15-second video or photo instead of typing  
> **Why:** Mobile-first, time-saving and visually compelling  
> **How:** Encourages more reviews from time-pressed users

---

### 3. 🏆 Review Rewards Hub
