# 📦 Flipkart Case Study: Increasing User Reviews Through Post-Purchase Innovation

This product case study explores how Flipkart can boost the number of user reviews on its platform by redesigning the post-purchase experience — making it more intuitive, rewarding, and mobile-first.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Despite being India’s leading e-commerce platform, Flipkart faces low user review rates, especially post-delivery. This leads to:
- Lower buyer trust
- Weaker product visibility (SEO/ranking)
- Fewer insights for sellers
- Reduced conversions on product pages

---

## 🎯 Objective

**Goal**: Transform the post-purchase flow into a trust-building and engaging experience to significantly increase **user review submissions**.

**Target Users**:
- Young working adults (21–35), primarily mobile-first users from Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities
- Regular Flipkart shoppers who prefer quick, visual feedback and use platforms like WhatsApp/Instagram

---

## 🔍 Key User Insights

- 6 out of 10 users **forget to leave a review** without reminders
- Most users prefer **visual feedback (photos/videos)** over text
- WhatsApp is more frequently used than the Flipkart app post-purchase
- Users lack **motivation** and **see no value** in writing reviews
- Review flows are long, robotic, and lack **emotional connection**

---

## 💡 Proposed Solutions

### 1. 🧠 **SmartPrompt**
- Sends a **timely notification or WhatsApp message** post-delivery
- Nudges users to leave a review when satisfaction is highest
- Reduces forgetfulness and review friction

### 2. 📸 **QuickSnap Review**
- Allows users to upload a **15-second video or image** instead of writing text
- Saves time and improves **engagement and credibility**

### 3. 🏆 **Review Rewards Hub**
- Gamified dashboard with **Flipkart Coins, badges, or vouchers**
- Incentivizes thoughtful reviews and builds a **habit loop**
